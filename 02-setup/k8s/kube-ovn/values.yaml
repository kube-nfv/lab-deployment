kube-ovn:
  # Tailscale uses 100.64.0.0/10 (CGNAT). The kube-OVN default join subnet
  # (100.64.0.0/16) is a subset of that range, causing two problems:
  # 1. etcd advertisedSubnets [100.64.0.0/10] picks up the ovn0 join IP and
  #    advertises it as a peer, breaking the etcd membership check.
  # 2. Tailscale captures the route to 100.64.0.1 (OVN join gateway), so the
  #    kube-ovn-cni gateway ping fails and the CNI crashes.
  # Use a join CIDR outside the Tailscale range.

    JOIN_CIDR: "10.200.0.0/16"
  # NOTE: kube-OVN DaemonSets (kube-ovn-cni, ovs-ovn, kube-ovn-pinger) use wildcard
  # tolerations (effect: NoSchedule, operator: Exists) in upstream templates — they run
  # on all nodes regardless of node.kubernetes.io/location taints. Verify this is
  # preserved after each chart upgrade. If removed, add to the relevant DaemonSet values:
  #   tolerations:
  #     - {effect: NoSchedule, operator: Exists}
  #     - {effect: NoExecute, operator: Exists}
